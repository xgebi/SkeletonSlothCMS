# Sloth

TLDR: **Unless you are brave, don't use this project.**

Sloth is a content management system that should serve my two needs:

1. Replace WordPress
    
    WordPress is an awesome piece of software that is good for a lot of users. That's a problem as I wanted to publish posts for which WordPress was not built.
2. Clear my bucket list of technical problems.
    
    This was a success.
