At the moment I am learning through courses. First one is Scott Jehl's [course on performance](https://scottjehl.com/lfwp/). Second course is [User Experience Design Fundamentals](https://www.udemy.com/course/user-experience-design-fundamentals/) because the back-end of my CMS needs improvements. Third is a [hands-on Rust course](https://www.udemy.com/course/hands-on-data-structures-and-algorithms-in-rust/).
